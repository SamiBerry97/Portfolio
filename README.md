## Introduction
The Bible Chatbot will help users feel closer to God by giving them a Bible verse of the day. The Bible verse will be saved in a text file and can be repeated until a new verse is requested. The used verses will be saved for 5 runs of the application. This will be using a device that is communicating with a Speaker and Microphone to give the user the Bible verse. This application will use Raspberry Pi, speaker, and microphone. This project can help people fill an empty void that they have from not being in Godâ€™s Word.
