## Introduction
The Bible Chatbot will help users feel closer to God by giving them a Bible verse of the day. The Bible verse will be saved in a text file and can be repeated until a new verse is requested. The used verses will be saved for 5 runs of the application. This will be using a device that is communicating with a Speaker and Microphone to give the user the Bible verse.
